# Guide to contributing

A simple guide on how to contribute to Yuga and earn that contributor role on Discord

1) Fork the reporistory!
You can do this by either directly forking it, or finding a file you wish to edit (package.json for example), and then it immediately forks it for you.

2) Make your changes
You can do this from the online editor, or use an IDE of choice (clone the reporistory first before even doing this)

3) Commit your changes

4) Create a pull request using the pull request button at the main page of your reporistory

After you create a pull request, our continuous integration service, Travis CI, will evaluate your code and check if there's any syntax errors or bugs.
If there is, we will request for you to change it. To do this, just go back to your reporistory and back to the file and make the edits we asked. If there's any misunderstandings or we have errors in our code and it isn't your fault, we'll apologise and merge your PR shortly after we check it.

Anyone can contribute, and after 10 contributions you can get a shiny new role on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FDNUgWC)!

Thanks for taking interest in Yuga and we hope to see good contributions from you guys!
Even the smallest things matter by the way.
