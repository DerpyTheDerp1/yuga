# Guide to making a "good" PR

1) Title it appropriately
Do NOT make it just "Update db.js" or "Update memes.js", make it something like "Added more memes to the db" or "Updated the MessageEmbed for memes.js"

2) Fill out the checkboxes
Seriosly, how hard is it?

3) When we request changes, actually make the changes and don't make more problems

4) Be patient when your PR takes 1 day to approve

5) If you need help, ask me @ Striker#7250 on Discord or in the PR comments.

Have fun, and please keep all this in mind when contributing!

Also if your repo is out of date and you need to pull latest data, create a pull request for that and we approve it asap.
